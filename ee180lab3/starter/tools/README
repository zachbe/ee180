README for tools/
=================

This folder contains the necessary files to build a MIPS cross compiler
and other utilities needed to make and test MIPS executables.

You may build these tools locally or use pre-compiled tools located at
/afs/ir.stanford.edu/class/ee180/mips_tc.

If you decide to build on your local machine, you will need a unix-like
environment (Linux, MacOs, Cygwin, etc.) and basic build tools (gcc,
make, etc.).

Irregardless of the method you choose, you will need to point the
simulation Makefile to the path of the tools.

Contents
--------

   gcc-mips/        A Makefile to download and build gcc.
   util/            A binary conversion utility for MIPS executables.
