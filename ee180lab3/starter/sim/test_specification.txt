Tests to include:
Overflow test
Address misalignment
Branch Hazards and forwarding
Delayed Branch resolution

Forwarding Cases

Producers: ex, mem, w
consumers: ID(set args for ex), ex (set addr for mem),
Producers to ID stage
-load/arith, nop, use: mem->id. ONLY WHEN NOT ALSO ARITH, USE. See Double Data Hazard in lecture 9
-load/arith, nop, nop, use: w -> id Only when not either load/arith,nop, use or arith, use
-arith, use: ex -> id.

Producers to ex stage: load address still has to go through id/alu to do offset, so no forwarding is possible

Stalling Cases
load-use (load arith, load addr load, load store)
Control Hazard



Within each test:
Signed and unsigned numbers
Forwarding cases: Forward to both rs and rt
