basic
    Sanity check. Input is a small image of all 0s, output should be some 0s.
    Ensures the accelerator is hooked up and correctly writing to the output
    buffer only at the locations required, and no more (i.e. only writes the
    correct number of pixels at the correct locations in output buffer memory).

image00
    Simple 4-by-4 image, output should be 4 bytes. There are no pixel
    saturations here (i.e. Sobel values greater than 255).
    
image01
    Same as image00 but tests Sobel pixel saturation with calculated values
    greater than 255.

image02
    Same as image00 but tests Endian-ness for consistency with the MIPS design.
    Also includes some saturation tests (in this case, it is a bug if anything
    does saturate).

image03
    Same as image02 except the row input order is flipped. Affects saturation.

image04
    Slightly larger 6-by-6 image, output should be 16 bytes. Tests output
    generation and addressing for a slightly larger output size.

image05
    Same as image04 except an 8-by-8 image; output should be 36 bytes.

imageMIPS
    Uses the same input and output buffers as the MIPS Sobel tests do.
