This test is used to verify the functionality of sobel_control. Its input is an array of words that count upward from 0. When reading from byte addresses, the data and the address can be compared to determine if the logic is processing the correct data in the correct sequence. The data is laid out such that a read from address 64 reads the word 64/4, which is 0x00000100.
