This test is used to verify the functionality of sobel_control. Its input is an array of bytes that count upward from 0. When reading from byte addresses, the data and the address can be compared to determine if the logic is processing the correct data in the correct sequence. The data is laid out such that a read from address 64 reads the word 0x40414243, which are the bytes 64,65,66,and 67.
